### Upgrading your license
To access the full range of Power Virtual Agents capabilities, you need to upgrade your plan to a standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription.

You can also [start a 60 day free trial of Power Virtual Agents](https://aka.ms/trypva) to try out all the capabilities. You'll be prompted to sign up for a trial if you try to create a bot without a license.

>[!NOTE]
>The option to create a free trial may be disabled. For more information, see the [Self-service sign-up disabled section](sign-up-individual.md#self-service-sign-up-disabled).

## Standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription
The standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription allows you to build chatbots on any supported channel and connect to any data using premium connectors. 


You can obtain a standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription from the Microsoft 365 admin center. Learn more at the [Assign licenses and manage access to Power Virtual Agents](requirements-licensing.md) topic.
